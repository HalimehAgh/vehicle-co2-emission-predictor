# Data Science Project: CO2 Emissions by Vehicles
## Project Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for a data science project focused on identifying vehicles with high CO2 emissions. The project is organized into multiple steps, each with specific deadlines and objectives.

### Project Timeline

#### Step 0: Framing (Our first meeting)
- **Deadline: January 19th**
- **Objective:** Define the context and scope of the project. Understand the concepts and conduct an initial exploration of the dataset.

#### Step 1: Data Mining + DataVizâ€™
- **Deadline: February 8th**
- **Objective:** Perform data mining and data visualization. Conduct an exhaustive analysis of the dataset to highlight structure, difficulties, and biases. Provide at least 5 graphical representations with detailed commentaries and validations.

#### Step 2: Pre-processing and Feature Engineering
- **Deadline: March 7th**
- **Objective:** Clean the dataset and perform necessary pre-processing steps. Transform and/or add features to prepare the dataset for in-depth analysis and modeling. Provide a data exploration, data visualization, and pre-processing report.

#### Step 3: Modeling
- **Step 1 Deadline: April 4th**
  - Elaborate the first modeling iterations with baseline models.
  - Analyze initial results and assess the relevance of your approach and model.

- **Step 2 Deadline: May 2nd**
  - Use Machine Learning and statistical metrics to understand model results.
  - Optimize the model, try other complex models, and compare results.

- **Step 3 Deadline: June 6th**
  - Advanced modeling using bagging/boosting and Deep Learning techniques.
  - Interpret results using interpretability tools.
  - Provide scientific and business conclusions based on modeling success or failure.
  - **Rendering 2:** Modeling report.

#### Step 5: Final Report + Codes on GitHub
- **Deadline: July 4th**
- Submit the final report, integrating the first two renderings, with a conclusion and an opening.
- Turn in clean and commented code on GitHub. Refine the model and modeling pipeline if time allows.

#### Step 6: Streamlit + Defense
- **Week of July 29th**
- Organize the defense presentation with a duration of 20 minutes for presentation and 10 minutes for questions from the jury members.
- Options for the presentation: Powerpoint + Streamlit demo or the entire presentation with the Streamlit application.
