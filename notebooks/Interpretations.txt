1) Distribution of CO2 Emissions by Car Fuel Type
The horizontal bar plot we created shows the mean CO2 emissions for different car fuel types. 
The order of the bars from top to bottom represents the ascending order of mean CO2 emissions. Here's an interpretation based on our observation:
- ES/GN (Ethanol/Gasoline): This category has the highest mean CO2 emissions among the displayed fuel types. It indicates that vehicles using a combination of Ethanol and Gasoline tend to emit more CO2 on average.

- EE (Electric/Electric): This category represents vehicles that are fully electric (Electric) and use an electric powertrain exclusively. 
The "EE" category has the lowest mean CO2 emissions among the displayed fuel types. The low CO2 emissions in this category indicate a reduced carbon footprint compared to vehicles with other fuel types.

- EL (Electric/LPG): The absence of a bar for this category in the plot suggests that there might be very few or no vehicles with the combination of Electric and LPG in the dataset. As a result, the dataset does not provide sufficient information to calculate a meaningful mean CO2 emissions value for this particular fuel type.

This is information about other fuel types:
FE (Electric)

ES (Electric/Gasoline) and Go (Gasoline)

GN/ES (Natural Gas/Electric)

EH (Electric/Hybrid)

GN (Natural Gas)

ES/GP (Electric/LPG)

GP/ES (LPG/Electric)

GH (Gasoline/Hybrid)

GL (LPG/Hybrid)
We need to consider that these interpretations are based on the mean values, and individual vehicles within each category may vary in their CO2 emissions. 

2. Relationship Between Power and CO2 Emissions
we can identify two observations based on this diagram:
- Vehicles with more power tend to have higher CO2 emissions and vise versa. This observation 
aligns with general expectations, as vehicles with higher power often have larger engines and may consume more fuel.

- A large number of data points are concentrated within a specific range of power values, such as between approximately 50 and 250. But, we have a large number of data points concentrated within a specific range of power values, such as between approximately 50 and 250.
The concentration of data points in a specific power range may indicate that many vehicles in the dataset share similar power characteristics. But, we need to explore the dataset further to see popular models or manufacturers within this power range.
Vehicles with extremely high power values (e.g., greater than 400 kW) are often high-performance or specialty vehicles. These could include sports cars, luxury vehicles, or other niche segments. The limited number of data points in this range might be reflective of the relatively lower production volume of such vehicles compared to mainstream models.
