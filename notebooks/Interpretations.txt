1) Distribution of CO2 Emissions by Car Fuel Type
The horizontal bar plot we created shows the mean CO2 emissions for different car fuel types. 
The order of the bars from top to bottom represents the ascending order of mean CO2 emissions. Here's an interpretation based on our observation:
- ES/GN (Ethanol/Gasoline): This category has the highest mean CO2 emissions among the displayed fuel types. It indicates that vehicles using a combination of Ethanol and Gasoline tend to emit more CO2 on average.

- EE (Electric/Electric): This category represents vehicles that are fully electric (Electric) and use an electric powertrain exclusively. 
The "EE" category has the lowest mean CO2 emissions among the displayed fuel types. The low CO2 emissions in this category indicate a reduced carbon footprint compared to vehicles with other fuel types.

- EL (Electric/LPG): The absence of a bar for this category in the plot suggests that there might be very few or no vehicles with the combination of Electric and LPG in the dataset. As a result, the dataset does not provide sufficient information to calculate a meaningful mean CO2 emissions value for this particular fuel type.

This is information about other fuel types:
FE (Electric)

ES (Electric/Gasoline) and Go (Gasoline)

GN/ES (Natural Gas/Electric)

EH (Electric/Hybrid)

GN (Natural Gas)

ES/GP (Electric/LPG)

GP/ES (LPG/Electric)

GH (Gasoline/Hybrid)

GL (LPG/Hybrid)
